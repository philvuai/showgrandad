## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/philvuai/showgrandad.git
   cd showgrandad
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Or with Netlify Functions support:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:netlify
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in terminal)

### Default Login

- **Username**: Any name (e.g., "John", "Mary", etc.)
- **Password**: `GrandadWebb!123`

> **Note**: The password can be changed in `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment to Netlify

### Option 1: Connect GitHub Repository

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Log into [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Build settings are automatically configured via `netlify.toml`
6. Deploy!

### Option 2: Drag and Drop

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag the `dist` folder to the deploy area

### Setting up FaunaDB (Optional)

For persistent cross-device storage, you can set up FaunaDB:

1. Go to [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com) and create a free account
2. Create a new database called `showgrandad`
3. Create a collection called `photos`
4. Create a server key in the FaunaDB dashboard
5. In your Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
6. Add a new variable: `FAUNADB_SECRET` with your FaunaDB server key
7. Redeploy your site

**Note**: The app works without FaunaDB using fallback storage, but FaunaDB provides true persistence.

## Cross-Device Photo Sharing

**Server-Side Storage**: Photos are now stored on the server using Netlify Functions with FaunaDB. This means:
- Photos uploaded on any device will appear on all devices
- True cross-device synchronization for the entire family
- Secure server-side storage with localStorage fallback

**For Family Use**: 
- Family members can upload photos from any device
- Grandad will see all photos from all family members
- Photos are automatically synced across phones, tablets, and computers

## Security Note

This application currently uses localStorage for data persistence and a simple password check. For production use with sensitive family photos, consider:

1. Using Netlify Functions for secure authentication
2. Implementing a proper database (like Netlify's Identity + FaunaDB)
3. Adding image optimization and secure cloud storage
4. Using environment variables for passwords
5. Implementing cross-device photo synchronization

## Customization

### Changing the Password

Edit `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` and update the `FAMILY_PASSWORD` constant:

```typescript
const FAMILY_PASSWORD = 'your-new-password';
```

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS with a custom color scheme inspired by Laravel Filament. You can customize colors in `tailwind.config.js`.

### Adding Features

- Photos are stored in localStorage (in a real app, use a database)
- Authentication is client-side only (in a real app, use server-side auth)
- No image optimization (in a real app, optimize images)
